# Text-to-Image-Stable-Diffusion

- Came across <a href="https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release">Stable Diffusion</a> (a deep learning, text-to-image model released by <a href="https://stability.ai/">Stability AI</a>).
- Created a simple tkinter interface for generating image from user's input text using Stable Diffusion.

As mentioned by Stability AI:

Currently NVIDIA chips are recommended. They will release optimisations to allow this to work on AMD, Macbook M1/M2 and other chipsets.
